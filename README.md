# Shopping List
## What is this?
This is a simple Flutter app that allows you to keep track of your shopping list. It is a part of my studies with [AcadeMind](https://www.academind.com/), and I want to give a huge thanks to [Codeium](https://codeium.com/) and [BlackBox AI](https://blackbox.ai/) for their help with this project.

## How does it work?
The app is very simple. You can add items to your shopping list by clicking on the "+" button on the bottom right corner of the screen. You can then type in the name of the item and click "Add" to add it to the list. You can also delete items from the list by swiping left on the item you want to delete.

## What can I do with this app?
You can use this app to keep track of the items you need to buy when you go shopping. You can also use it to keep track of other lists of items, such as a to-do list or a list of items you want to buy online.

## What do I need to run this app?
You need to have the Flutter SDK installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Flutter website.

## How do I run this app?
You can run this app by opening the terminal and typing "flutter run" in the folder where the app is located. You can also open the app in an IDE like Android Studio or Visual Studio Code and run it from there.

## What can I do with the code?
You can use this code as a starting point for your own Flutter app. You can also use it to learn how to build a Flutter app. The code is open source, so you can do whatever you want with it. Just remember to give me credit if you use it in your own app.
